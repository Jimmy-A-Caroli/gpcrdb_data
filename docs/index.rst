Welcome to the GPCRdb documentation
===================================

The GPCRdb contains data, diagrams and web tools for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Users can browse all GPCR crystal structures and the largest collection of receptor mutants.
Diagrams can be produced and downloaded to illustrate receptor residues (snake-plot and helix box diagrams) and
relationships (phylogenetic trees). Reference (crystal) structure-based sequence alignments take into account helix
bulges and constrictions, display statistics of amino acid conservation and have been assigned generic
residue numbering for equivalent residues in different receptors.

The `source code`_ and `source data`_ are freely available on `GitHub`_.

Below, a table overview of all the different pages and functionalities in GPCRdb grouped by sections, along links to specific documentation pages, associated slides and video demonstrations.
